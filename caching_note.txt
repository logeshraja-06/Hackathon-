Caching & Offline Fallback Strategy
====================================
- Framework Used: `shared_preferences`.
- Profile Caching: In `farmer_state.dart`, the user's customized name, location, and language preference are persisted locally.
- Offline behavior: If closing and reopening the app without network, these details load instantaneously in `_loadProfile()`.
- Scale up: For JSON data arrays (mock demand/buyers), SharedPreferences or a SQLite local database (like Isar/sqflite) could be implemented to store the last-fetched API string, serving it immediately before making fresh REST calls, avoiding loading spinners during startup.
